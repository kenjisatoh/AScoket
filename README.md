ASocket
=================

This is an Asynchronous socket library for Arduino with an ethernet shield with the W5100 ethernet chip.

The built in libraries only provide blocking IO calls which limits more advanced uses and may interfere with other time sensative operations the micro is trying to acheive.

####Provided Libraries:

- Async Sockets, TCP, UDP, IGMP
- DHCP Client built on AScoket
- DNS Client built on ASocket
- NTP Client built on Ascoket

####Example Sketches:
- WebClient
- WebServer
- ChatServer
- NtpClient
